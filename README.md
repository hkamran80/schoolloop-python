schoolloop_password = getpass()
s2 = login(schoolloop_subdomain, schoolloop_username, schoolloop_password)

homework = sl.get_homework()
for h in homework:
  if h[4] == 1:
    print(h[0] + " in " + h[1] + " due TODAY!" )
  elif h[4] == 2:
    print(h[0] + " in " + h[1] + " due TOMORROW!")

from getpass import getpass

schoolloop_subdomain = input("Subdomain: ")
schoolloop_username = input("Username: ")
schoolloop_password = getpass()
s2 = login(schoolloop_subdomain, schoolloop_username, schoolloop_password)

grades = sl.get_grades()
for g in grades:
   if str(g[3]) == "No grades published by teacher":
      g_letter = ""
   else:
      g_letter = " (" + str(g[4]) + ")"
   print(str(g[0]) + "Â°: " + str(g[1]) + " (" + str(g[2]) + "): " + str(g[3]) + g_letter)
